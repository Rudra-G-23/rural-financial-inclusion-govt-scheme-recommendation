## 2️⃣0️⃣2️⃣5️⃣

### 1st Week (Oct 22 - Oct 26)
- **Oct 22, 2025** – Dataset downloaded & collected.
- **Oct 23, 2025** - Added Data Dictionary of HCES 2023-24 with Links.
- **Oct 24, 2025** 
  - Break the big data into smaller Parquet dataset
  - With Log file and modular code
  - Error in 2, 12, 13, 14 file
  - Level 2 is incorrect file name 
  - Level 12, 13, 14 corrupt file --> again downloaded 
  - Final Review at 20:38 IST
- **Oct 25, 2025**
  - Chunks are too small less 1MB 
  - So converted into a single parquet data for each level 11:42 IST
  - During the csv file conversion level 2 file is corrupt 18:15 IST
    - So again Download dta file then chunk wise 
    - Then convert to merged parquet file 
    - Then csv file. 
    - Rather than Running the whole scripts i do with notebook. 18:58 IST
  - Create the data profiling on each level.
    - If dataset is more than 500 MB 
    - Then it take only 2_000_000 rows 19:42 IST
  - Generate the auto viz to Visualize the data
    - Take the sample of 1_00_000 rows 
    - I think it take time 😅 Now is 21:30 IST
    - Check the log for more details Now done 23:26 IST
    - Few error is occur but we do in raw datasets 
    - After all the feature engineering done if need we do again 23:38 IST
- **Oct 26, 2025**
  - 07:41 IST >> Add the SSH Key & Push files safely
    - Files are large so issues to commit 
    - Means level scatter plots are doing issues
    - Lev-2 (196MB), Lev-3 (110MB), Lev-09 (415MB), Lev-15  (114MB) ...etc
    - So do some gpt work then finally done 08:38 IST
    - Finally, All published & git is clean from both local and remote 08:57 IST
  - 11:42 IST >> Organize the files for better access
    - Organize file is most important for the project and team work 12:03 IST

### 2nd Week (Oct 26- Nov 1)
- **Oct 27, 2025**
  - 19:00 IST >> Data Health Check 
    - Checklist for the faster analysis about data 
    - Create our Project Overview 
  - 21:00 IST >> Feature Summary 
    - All level Feature summary (Min, max, count, missing values, ...etc)
- **Oct 28, 2025**
  - 06:10 IST >> Database Diagram 
    - Level 1-5 ready 17:44 IST
    - All Level Diagram post 20:32 IST
    - 🤝 : Variables and MP
    - Share a google sheet both side 
- **Oct 29, 2025**
  - 04:30 IST >> Nice Data
    - Wake up from the morning 
    - So excited about the data
    - When the features are clear and all parameter is ready.
    - So i think it is very simple data
    - And for now we break down the data to focus only on MP 
    - More cool
  - 07:40 IST >> Feature Selection
    - Clean the data 🧹 Level 02 data 
    - I think about the feature engineering ideas 
    - If I go in this much level of depth it take the time 
    - And we all know the data cleaning and feature engineering 
    - It is the most time taken and it affect the model  20:09 IST
    - 21:23 IST 3 level analysis
  
- **30 Oct, 2025**
  - Working on the Report the design 
  
- **31 Oct, 2025**
  - 07:54 IST >> Level 02 EDA
    - in level 02 why the age is started the from 01 age 
    - How this possible a small boy survey possible
    - Change the level 2 age into the forward filling 
    - Level 02 EDA 01 Done 21:46 IST
  
- **31 Oct, 2025**
  - 6:00 IST >> Level 03 Data Cleaning
    -  Now I do the data cleaning of the level 03 
    -  Lets see within less than 2 hour i complete or not.
    -  Within 30 Min i Completed the data cleaning
  - 06:55 IST >> EDA Start of the level 03
    - Level 03 contains the 40 features 
    - So update the data dict because all the data is labeled 
    - Two hour is finished time is off I don't go the collage
    - I change me mind to go the college due to the project phrase so 
  
- **Nov 1, 2025**
  - 07:05 IST >> level 03 EDA 01
    - I think, I finished this eda within the 1 hour 
    - But I take the 2 hour almost
    - After dinner I started again for the level 5
    - It contains fewer features,
    - So I to the quick EDA
