# 👨‍💻 Data & Code Folder

- For each level we have a separate folder for easier to navigate
- Inside each file we got the notebooks and Meta data file.
  - Metadata `*.json` file is created during the file conversion time.
  - All data dictionary `*.md` documents are created by extracting the text form the website.
- Added a All level Folder to store overall data related work.
